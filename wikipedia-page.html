            <p><strong>Web colors</strong> are colors used in displaying web pages on the World Wide Web,
             and the methods for describing and specifying those colors. Colors may be specified as
             <ul>
                <li>an RGB triplet or</li>
                <li>in hexadecimal format (a hex triplet) or</li>
                <li>according to their common English names in some cases.</li>
            </ul>

        <div>
            <h2 id="hex-triplet">Hex triplet</h2>
                <p>A hex triplet is a six-digit, three-byte hexadecimal number used in HTML, CSS, SVG, and other computing applications to
             represent colors. The bytes represent the red, green, and blue components of the color. One byte represents a number in
              the range 00 to FF (in hexadecimal notation), or 0 to 255 in decimal notation.
               This represents the least (0) to the most (255) intensity of each of the color components. Thus web colors specify colors
                in the 24-bit RGB color scheme. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Hex_triplet">More about Hex triplet</a>

                       Recent W3C specifications of color names distinguishes between basic and extended colors.[6] 
            In HTML and XHTML, colors can be used for text, background color, frame borders, tables, and individual table cells.

               <h3> Basic colors</h3>
                <p> The basic colors are 16 colors defined in the HTML 4.01 specification, ratified in 1999,[8] 
                    as follows (names are defined in this context to be case-insensitive)

            <h2>CSS colors</h2>
                <p>The Cascading Style Sheets specification defines the same number of named colors as the HTML 4 spec, namely the 16 html colors,
             and 124 colors from the Netscape X11 color list for a total of 140 names that were recognized by Internet Explorer (IE) 3.0
              and Netscape Navigator 3.0.

                    <h2> Web-safe colors</h2>
         
                         <p>In the mid-1990s, many displays were only capable of displaying 256 colors.[25] These may be dictated by the hardware or changeable
                          by a "color table". When a color is found (e.g., in an image) that is not available, a different one had to be used. This can be done
                          by either using the closest color or by using dithering.
         
                         There were various attempts to make a "standard" color palette. A set of colors was needed that could be shown without dithering on
                         256-color displays; the number 216 was chosen partly because computer operating systems customarily reserved sixteen to twenty colors
                         for their own use; it was also selected because it allows exactly six equally spaced shades of red, green, and blue (6 × 6 × 6 = 216), 
                         each from 00 to FF (including both limits).

                 <h3>Color selection</h3>
                    <p>
                    Some browsers and devices do not support colors. For these displays or blind and colorblind users, Web content depending on 
                    colors can be unusable or difficult to use.
                
                     Either no colors should be specified (to invoke the browser's default colors), or both the background and all foreground colors 
                    (such as the colors of plain text, unvisited links, hovered links, active links, and visited links) should be specified to avoid
                    black on black or white on white effects.[29]

                 <h3>Color contrast</h3>
                    <p>
                    The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines recommend a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 between the relative luminance of text 
                    and its background color[30] or at least 3:1 for large text. Enhanced accessibility requires contrast ratios greater than 7:1.
